## TCP-UDP-Program

This repository consists of all TCP/UDP programs in C that we learned during the Computer Network Lab in KIIT" implies that there is a repository, likely an online code repository such as GitHub or Bitbucket, that contains a collection of C programs related to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

The programs included in this repository were likely developed as part of a computer network laboratory course at KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) or a similar educational institution. The purpose of the laboratory course was to provide hands-on experience in understanding and implementing TCP and UDP protocols.

TCP and UDP are two prominent protocols used in computer networks. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between network hosts, ensuring that data packets arrive in order and without errors. UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that enables fast, low-latency communication but does not guarantee packet delivery or order.

The repository mentioned in the statement likely contains various C++ programs that demonstrate the concepts and functionality of TCP and UDP protocols. These programs may cover topics such as establishing TCP connections, sending and receiving data using TCP sockets, implementing UDP datagram communication, handling network errors, and other related topics.

By having access to this repository, students or individuals interested in computer networking can review, learn from, and experiment with the provided C++ programs. They can study the code, modify it, or use it as a reference to develop their own network applications or understand the underlying principles of TCP and UDP protocols in more depth.
